Additional new checks after destroot could include:

  * verify the binaries in the output directory match the requested architectures (especially for `+universal`)
  * verify linked libraries are provided by MacPorts or the system (no `/usr/local`)
  * verify libraries were linked using `-headerpad_max_install_names`
  * verify binaries/libraries were linked to libraries from ports declared as dependencies only
  * if no binary files exist at all, propose to add `supported_archs no` to the Portfile
  * verify all created symlinks will point to a existing path after activation
  * Python/Perl/Ruby scripts in `${prefix}/bin/` use the right interpreters (no `/usr/bin`, correct version matching the dependencies)
  * ...
